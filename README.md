### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data 

### Project Description
The Explore US Bikeshare project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three 
major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The program imports cleaned 
raw data from existing .csv files hidden away in .gitignore and answers interesting questions about it 
by computing descriptive statistics. It is built to be interactive so users can explore data for any 
city, month or day, as they so choose. Results are presented in the terminal.
